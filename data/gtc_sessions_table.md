|  | Toward Better Compute-Memory Balance in GPU-Enabled Density-Based CFD Solvers [P73604] | Jeff Lee (Jeff Lee)<br>Dmitry Mikushin (Dmitry Mikushin)<br>Hiroaki Nishikawa (Hiroaki Nishikawa)<br>Yoshitaka Nakashima (Yoshitaka Nakashima)<br>Xun Jia (Xun Jia) | We present the transition of our unstructured polyhedral flow solver, scFLOW, to a fully GPU-resident architecture. We concentrate on an implicit multicolor Gauss-Seidel density-based CFD (computational fluid dynamics) solver, parallelized with OpenMP target offload. The solver, which offers Rusanov and HLLC fluxes for the inviscid flux and alpha-damping method for the viscous flux, executes continuously on the GPU with all data persistent in the GPU memory. We propose Frechet derivative for GPU-oriented numerical design of the CFD solver with more compact memory footprint, portable OpenMP code for multicore and GPU offload, and C++ templates for generating highly-tuned code paths. Our results demonstrate the ability to fit very large problems into a single A100 GPU, enabling the simulation of problems previously feasible only with a multinode cluster. The current prototype solver on a single NVIDIA A100 is 20% faster than our previous-generation solver running on 192 CPU threads of 4x AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs. |  |  |  | We present the transition of our unstructured polyhedral flow solver, scFLOW, to a fully GPU-residen... |
