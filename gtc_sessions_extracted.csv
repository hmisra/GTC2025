The field has evolved through multiple hypotheses, beginning with search as a solution, followed by knowledge-based systems, and, most recently, leveraging large language models for robotics. Yet, the challenge of creating generalist embodied agents capable of performing thousands of tasks across diverse environments remains unsolved. Building such a generalist robotic agent presents a ""chicken-and-egg"" problem: to train agents for generalization, we need vast amounts of robotic/agent data from varied environments, but gathering such data is impractical without deploying robots/agents that already generalize. I propose a new framework that leverages alternative sources of ""indirect"" supervision to build robotic agents from the ground up. I'll focus on three key principles: (1) How to generate self-supervised data for training robots? (2) How to bootstrap robot learning by observing human videos? and (3) How can robots learn to adapt via large-scale training in simulation? I'll demonstrate this framework's potential for scaling robotics AI through several case studies.",10:00 AM - 10:40 AM PDT,,,javascript:void(),Deepak Pathak,Deepak Pathak

,Automate 5G Network Configurations With NVIDIA AI LLM Agents and Kinetica Accelerated Database [DLIT72350],https://register.nvidia.com/flow/nvidia/gtcs25/ap/page/catalog/session/1726502761718001tRFy,"Learn how to create AI agents using LangGraph and NVIDIA NIM to automate 5G network configurations. You'll deploy LLM agents to monitor real-time network quality of service (QoS) and dynamically respond to congestion by creating new network slices. LLM agents will process logs to detect when QoS falls below a threshold, then automatically trigger a new slice for the affected user equipment. Using graph-based models, the agents understand the network configuration, identifying impacted elements. This ensures efficient, AI-driven adjustments that consider the overall network architecture.
We'll use the Open Air Interface 5G lab to simulate the 5G network, demonstrating how AI can be integrated into real-world telecom environments. You'll also gain practical knowledge on using Python with LangGraph and NVIDIA AI endpoints to develop and deploy LLM agents that automate complex network tasks.

We propose a streamlined, AI-driven method to automate the curation and classification of large disaster image datasets. This approach leverages pre-trained recognition models to extract labels and processes the data through custom word embeddings to generate similarity scores. AWS Rekognition, integrated with Lambda triggers, simplifies label extraction, while the NV-Embed-v2 model improves classification accuracy by ranking term relevance. This solution enhances the organization of large-scale disaster repositories, making it easier to retrieve critical insights. The proposed method can improve post-disaster analysis and resilience efforts, addressing the challenges of unstructured data with greater efficiency and accuracy.",,,,,Sun Ho Ro,Sun Ho Ro

,Deploying RAG Pipelines for Production at Scale [DLIW73643],https://register.nvidia.com/flow/nvidia/gtcs25/ap/page/catalog/session/1730224904265001qmx4,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are revolutionizing enterprise operations. However, most existing tutorials stop at proof-of-concept implementations that falter when scaling. This workshop aims to bridge that gap, focusing on building scalable, production-ready RAG pipelines powered by NVIDIA NIM microservices and Kubernetes. Participants will gain hands-on experience deploying, monitoring, and scaling RAG pipelines with the NIM Operator and learn best practices for infrastructure optimization, performance monitoring, and handling high traffic volumes.
The workshop begins by building a simple RAG pipeline using the NVIDIA API catalog. Participants will deploy and test individual components in a local environment using Docker Compose. Once familiar with the basics, the focus will shift to deploying NIMs, such as LLM, NeMo Retriever Text Embedding, and NeMo Retriever Text Reranking, in a Kubernetes cluster using the NIM Operator. This will include managing the deployment, monitoring, and scalability of NVIDIA NIM microservices. Building on these deployments, the workshop will cover constructing a production-grade RAG pipeline using the deployed NIMs and explore NVIDIA's blueprint for PDF ingestion, learning how to integrate it into the RAG pipeline.
To ensure operational efficiency, the workshop will introduce Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring pipeline performance, cluster health, and resource utilization. Scalability will be addressed through the use of the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for dynamically scaling NIMs based on custom metrics in conjunction with the NIM Operator. Custom dashboards will be created to visualize key metrics and interpret performance insights.
You’ll be able to:

Build a simple RAG pipeline using API endpoints, deployed locally with Docker Compose.
Deploy a variety of NVIDIA NIM microservices in a Kubernetes cluster using the NIM Operator.
Combine NIMs into a cohesive, production-grade RAG pipeline and integrate advanced data ingestion workflows.
Monitor RAG pipelines and Kubernetes clusters with Prometheus and Grafana.
Scale NIMs to handle high traffic using the NIM Operator.
Create, deploy, and scale RAG pipelines for a variety of agentic workflows, including PDF ingestion.


Prerequisite(s):

Familiarity working with LLM-based applications.
Familiarity with RAG pipelines.
Familiarity working with Kubernetes.
Familiarity working with Helm.


Certificate: Upon successful completion of the assessment, you’ll receive an NVIDIA certificate to recognize your subject matter competency and support your professional career growth.",1:00 AM - 9:00 AM PDT,Full-Day Workshop Room 9 (Virtual),,,Juan Jose Durillo Barrionuevo,Juan Jose Durillo Barrionuevo

We implemented an accelerated pipeline to compute QPFs directly from WSIs. The pipeline is built using PyTorch and designed to run efficiently on the GPU. It includes tissue and tumor detection, cell instance segmentation, and the computation of cellular features (texture and shape features). Our first prototype showed more than a magnitude of speedup compared to a popular open-source library.

GPU-accelerated QPFs have the potential to bring down the computation time of many novel medical applications (that are currently research-only) to a level where they meet turnaround requirements for clinical use.",,,,,Nils Bruenggel,Nils Bruenggel

We propose a lightweight optimization technique, called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of these MoE models. By carefully examining the conditional probability in tokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE models implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity. We then design an efficient integer programming model to capture such features and show that by properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67% cross-GPU routing latency. Our solution beats the cutting-edge MoE implementations with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2X improvement in inference throughput.",,,,,Dhabaleswar Panda,Dhabaleswar Panda

A defect spreads. A supply chain stalls. Traditional factories react — fixing issues after they occur. But what if your factory already knew? What if it predicted failures before they happened? If AI-driven vision caught defects early? If supply chains adapted in real time? This is not the future — it's happening now. TCS’s Design for Intelligence, powered by NVIDIA platforms — Omniverse for digital twins, Metropolis for vision AI, TAO Toolkit and NIM for scalable AI, Cosmos for generative simulations, and GR00T for AI-driven robotics in manufacturing — is enabling AI-first factories that predict, adapt, and optimize in real time. The result? Resilient supply chains, zero-defect quality, and intelligent automation at scale. See how future-ready factories are shifting from reactive to truly intelligent — because in manufacturing’s next era, you lead or fall behind.

By leveraging the vast pool of English data — while carefully injecting a small, high-quality corpus from the target language — we trained state-of-the-art multilingual models without incurring massive computational overhead. We'll introduce the concept of Knowledge Bridging, where a model’s “world knowledge” is largely learned through English, and then “bridged” to the target language with comparatively modest, region-specific data. See how this approach contrasts with naïve pre-training recipes (e.g., equal-ratio or monolingual emphasis) and why continual pre-training on an existing open-source checkpoint underperforms. We'll also highlight best practices for tokenizer design and data mixture strategies. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this method not only sustains high performance on English benchmarks, but also significantly boosts target-language proficiency — making it an ideal recipe for building sovereign AI solutions in regions like Korea, Japan, and beyond.

The MemPBPF algorithm achieves feasible paths, considering minimum path length, safety, and smoothness. The MemPBPF algorithm combines membrane computing with a pseudo-bacterial genetic algorithm — specifically, a membrane-inspired evolutionary algorithm with a one-level membrane structure — and the artificial potential field method to find the parameters to solve the robot path planning problem efficiently. The path-planning problem in mobile robots is one of the most computationally intensive tasks; in that sense, heterogeneous computing helps to gain performance. Employing GPUs is possible to process data-intensive tasks efficiently — in this work, the evaluation of solution paths.",,,,,Ulises Orozco,Ulises Orozco

,Novel Uses for AI to Drive Monetization in Large M&E Archives [S72715],https://register.nvidia.com/flow/nvidia/gtcs25/ap/page/catalog/session/1727745122334001ZRLR,"In 1928, a Norwegian doctor put an original print of Carl Dreyer’s silent movie “The Passion of Joan of Arc” in a janitor’s closet in an insane asylum. This new cut was discovered during renovations 53 years later, changing our understanding of the film. Hopefully, most media companies don’t store in janitor’s closets, but most have hundreds of thousands of hours of footage sitting dormant, stored with little more information than the file name.

Learn how using a NIMS-based contextual analysis for metadata ingest within a software-defined broadcast pipeline can make your active media and archive searchable by a frame’s visual contents, and even the greater context around it. These data allow for dynamic and novel opportunities for monetization and personalization. We'll discuss how contextual metadata can be produced and refined recursively within a TAMS (time-addressable media) framework to add and amend metadata each time footage is retrieved. These data can be used to generate retrieval-augmented generation models for everything from anomaly detection to predictive/suggestive editing and FAST-content generation. 
Discover how a news organization will use metadata to “Control F” through their archive, and how a racing company will use their contextual data to create models to predict camera switching, improve safety, and generate user-specific narratives. We’ll close with an exploration of how media & entertainment (M&E) contextual data pipelines can be used outside our industry, from avoiding collisions with self-driving cars to sonar analysis.","TAMS-based storage systems allow the archive to be searchable and stored by context, rather than filename and date",,,,Lewis Smithingham,Lewis Smithingham

We propose to enhance CS-ASR systems by utilizing rich unsupervised monolingual data within a semi-supervised learning framework. To achieve this, we establish a general paradigm for applying noisy student training (NST) to the CS-ASR task. We introduce the LLM-Filter, to activate the correction capability of LLMs for monolingual data selection and pseudo-labels refinement during NST. Our method not only achieves significant improvements over supervised and semi-supervised learning baselines for the CS task, but also attains better performance compared with the fully-supervised oracle upper-bound on the CS English part. Additionally, we further investigate the influence of accent on AESRC dataset and demonstrate that our method can achieve additional benefits when the monolingual data contain relevant linguistic characteristics.",,,,,Wen Ding,Wen Ding

In part, this is because of the substantial bias of precipitation forecasts in conventional models, and also because precipitation exhibits variability on scales of a kilometer, with the precipitation often produced by local events such as thunderstorms
whose positions cannot be specified with precision. Potentially, with a large ensemble, one could better understand and quantify the likelihood of heavy precipitation, which has some modulation from large-scale weather patterns.

On the infrastructure side, at least 10 telcos have deployed sovereign AI infrastructure, enabling them to turbocharge AI initiatives in their domestic market. On operational activities, the spate of Gen AI initiatives across different segments of the telecom business is accelerating. On preparing for the future, we saw the launch of the first AI-radio access network (RAN) in Japan and accompanying acceleration of activities at the AI-RAN Alliance to develop technologies and capabilities for the 5G+ and 6G era. These industry developments highlight that going AI-first is now every telco's default aspiration. NVIDIA is enabling the industry on this journey, providing the hardware and software platforms, tools, and blueprints for the AI-first telco. NVIDIA SVP Telecoms, Ronnie Vasishta, will talk about how NVIDIA is working with its partners to deliver on this ambition and announce new platforms, tools, and blueprints that NVIDIA is bringing to the market.

Benchmarks like MedQA, USMLE, and MMLU don't tell the whole story. And while real-world trials are crucial, they take time — often so long that the AI has already moved on by the time results are in. With proliferating model choices both open (Med42-v2, Meditron-3, OpenBioLLM) and closed (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini, etc.), we need a structured way to evaluate LLMs quickly and thoroughly, helping us select the right one for specific medical tasks.

That's why we developed MEDIC, a new framework to assess LLMs more comprehensively. It looks at key areas like medical reasoning, ethics, and safety, giving us a clearer picture of how these models might perform in actual clinical settings. We also introduce a novel cross-examination framework that helps detect hallucination, assess coverage, and other metrics for applications such as clinical note generation, among others.",5:00 AM - 5:40 AM PDT,EMEA Simulive Room 5,,javascript:void(),Praveenkumar Kanithi,Praveenkumar Kanithi

AI is transforming media production by changing how we create, handle, and share content. It helps artists and writers generate scripts, music, and visual effects. Natural language processing and transformer models are now used to create dialogue and story outlines, aiding storytellers in crafting narratives. In music, AI helps compose new pieces and improve others. For visual effects, it’s being used for tasks such as rotoscoping, adjusting colors, and creating computer-generated imagery more efficiently. In the realm of media distribution, AI is optimizing content delivery and personalization. Recommendation systems, powered by AI, analyze user data to suggest content that aligns with individual preferences, thereby enhancing viewer engagement. AI is also instrumental in managing digital rights, detecting copyright infringements, and ensuring compliance with licensing agreements. As AI continues to evolve, it will further disrupt traditional media production workflows, offering new creative possibilities while also raising important ethical considerations around authenticity and content manipulation. We'll highlight recent advances in technology and software products embracing this new world.

AI agents are the new digital workforce, working for and with us. They can reason about a mission, create a plan, and retrieve data or use tools to generate a quality response. Data is the fuel for AI agents, but the magnitude and scale of enterprise data often make it too expensive and time-consuming to leverage effectively. For enterprises to thrive in the AI era, they must find a way to make use of all of their data. Join this session to learn about tools and frameworks to more easily build agentic AI systems that connectAI agents to a library of reusable tools that unlock your data, and drive efficiency gains across the organization.

There are several challenges with developing agentic AI systems: Connecting the many AI agent frameworks and orchestration tools that currently exist, Evaluation and benchmarking of agentic AI systems,  Telemetry and logging are important for complex agentic AI workflows or production environments Achieving the best performance requires system-level accelerations which can be implemented only with knowledge of the entire system
Learn about technologies that will help with building full-stack accelerated agentic AI systems that accelerate developer velocity and provide built-in interoperability to choose from the best available frameworks for your task.

Quantum phase estimation (QPE) with a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) is particularly notable for its potential to perform precise calculations with exponential speedup. As FTQC advances rapidly, studying FTQC algorithms has become urgent. We've developed a general framework for QPE-based quantum chemical calculations of the ground and excited electronic states of sizable molecules, such as those containing aromatic rings. Our workflow, implemented on a general purpose GPU (GPGPU) environment, shows that the GPGPU accelerates calculations faster than 48-CPU simulations without GPGPU.

一方で、シミュレーションが作るシンセティックデータによるAI学習は、自動運転など多くの分野ですでに実用化されており、AIの性能を飛躍的に上げることが知られているが、創薬分野では質と量を兼ね備えたシミュレーション手法がなかったため、実用化に至っていなかった。
今回、我々は既存の最新の手法に比べ数百から数千倍高速で高精度、かつリファレンスデータの不要な革新的な化合物活性予測シミュレーターを開発した。本セッションでは、この技術の概要・特徴と、AI創薬への応用について議論したい。

From discovery to the clinic, drug development takes about 15 years and costs a huge amount of money, said to be around 200 billion yen, while the success rate is low, with only one in 30,000 compounds reaching the market. Therefore, there has long been a need for efficiency at all stages of the process. In recent years, as one approach to efficiency, high expectation have been placed on AI drug discovery models that use huge amounts of data, such as electronic medical records, research paper information, and compound structure and evaluation data. However, the huge amount of data that is available as a training resource for the AI models has various issues, including diversity and low reproducibility. As a result, drug discovery AI that has no choice but to learn from inaccurate data does not perform as expected. On the other hand, AI learning using synthetic data created by simulation has already been put to practical use in many fields such as autonomous driving, and is known to dramatically improve the performance of AI, but in the drug discovery field, there has been no simulation method that combined quality and quantity, so it has not been put to practical use. We have developed an innovative compound activity prediction simulator that is hundreds to thousands of times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods while still maintaining high accuracy and with the additional benefit that it does not require reference data. In this session, we would like to discuss the overview and features of this technology and its application to AI drug discovery.",10:00 PM - 10:50 PM PDT,APAC Simulive Room 2,,,寺田 央,寺田 央
